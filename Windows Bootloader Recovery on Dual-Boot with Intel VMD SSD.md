# Windows Bootloader Recovery on Dual-Boot with Intel VMD SSD

This guide helps recover Windows bootloader on dual-boot with **Intel Rapid Storage Technology (RST) VMD SSDs**.

## 0. Requirements

- USB flash drive (≥8 GB, all data will be erased).
- Another drive of type **FAT32** or **NTFS** (no data will be erased, exFAT/ext4 won't work, hereafter referred to as Another drive).
- Any computer or Live USB of any system.

Or

- Bootable Windows 11 USB.
- Compatible Intel Rapid Storage Technology (RST) VMD Driver (unzipped) in another drive of type **FAT32** or **NTFS** (no data will be erased, exFAT/ext4 won't work, hereafter referred to as Another drive).

## 1. Creating a Bootable Windows 11 USB

If you already have a Bootable Windows 11 USB, skip this section.

On any computer or Live USB of any system:

1. Download the **Windows 11 ISO** from <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11>.
2. Insert the USB flash drive.
3. Install and open any software that can flash OS to flash drive, e.g. **balenaEtcher** (Linux, Windows, MacOS), **dd** (Linux), **Rufus** (Windows), **WoeUSB** (Linux).
4. Flash the ISO into the USB flash drive (all data will be erased). The software may show warnings, ignore it and continue flashing.

## 2. Download Intel Rapid Storage Technology (RST) VMD Drive

We need `.inf`, `.sys`, and `.cat` files of the Intel Rapid Storage Technology VMD Driver that is compatible with your CPU generation (e.g. Intel 12th–15th Gen) to be put in Another drive. If you already have it, skip this section.

```
git clone https://github.com/sispt/Intel-Rapid-Storage-Technology-RST-VMD-Drivers-Extracted
```
and copy the driver folder you need to the Another drive. If not sure, copy all driver folders and select the compatible ones according to **Windows 11 Setup** latter.

## 3. Boot from Windows 11 USB

<li>Click <strong>Browse</strong>, if the Windows partition is not detected, load the compatible Intel Rapid Storage Technology VMD Driver by selecting the folder containing it and pressing <strong>Install</strong> until your Windows partition (assumed (E:) here) appears. Check **Hide drivers that aren't compatible with this computer's harware** and load the drivers that are not hidden if you aren't sure which driver(s) to load. If the Windows partition is detected, skip this step.</li>
<li>Press <code>Shift + F10</code> to open <strong>Command Prompt</strong>.</li>

You should see <code>Boot files successfully created</code>.</li>
<li>Close <strong>Command Prompt</strong> and <strong>Windows 11 Setup</strong>. It will reboot automatically. Don't boot from the bootable Windows 11 USB. The bootable Windows 11 USB and the Another drive can be removed.</li>
<li>Boot into Windows. It should load normally.</li>
